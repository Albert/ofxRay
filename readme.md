# Introduction

A lightweight set of tools for intersection testings (e.g. does a ray intersect a plane).

# Objects

## Ray

A ray here is defined by the starting point __s__ and the transmission vector __t__ . Check equation (5) at http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Line.html

We define a ray as an infinite line (continuing infinitely forwards and backwards along the line __t__ and -__t__ starting at __s__ .

A _Line segment_ is a line which has finite length. We denote a line segment  as a line between __s__ and __t__ where __infinite__ is set to _false_ .
